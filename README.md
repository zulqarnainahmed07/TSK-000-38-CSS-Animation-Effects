## CSS Animations and Transitions
I've incorporated CSS animations and transitions to create smooth and visually appealing interactions throughout the website:
- **Button Hover Effects**: Buttons change background color and text color smoothly on hover.
- **Scrolling Animations**: Sections fade in and animate when scrolling to enhance user experience.
- **Keyframes**: Custom animations are used to bring elements like text and images to life.

Feel free to explore the repository to see these animations in action and learn more about my skills and professional journey!
